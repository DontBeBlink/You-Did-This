# Game Design Document: You Did This

## Core Concept
A puzzle platformer where players create "clones" to solve spatial and timing puzzles. Each clone repeats the playerâ€™s previous actions, and is sometimes the key to progress or an obstacle to avoid.

## Main Mechanic âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Clone Creation**: Players can create clones manually (L key) or automatically every 15 seconds
- **Action Recording**: Every player input and physics state is recorded at 50Hz for accurate replay  
- **Physics-Perfect Replay**: Clones reproduce exact movement, timing, and interactions
- **Goal-Based Sticking**: Clones become permanently stuck when reaching their designated goals
- **Clone Management**: Up to 10 clones supported with automatic cleanup of oldest clones
- **Retraction System**: Planned feature for returning to previous clone states

## Gameplay Flow
1. Start as a single character.
2. Navigate platforms, switches, and obstacles.
3. When needed, create a clone:
    - Old clone replays your recorded actions on a loop (or just continues to the goal).
    - You take control of the new clone to solve the next part of the puzzle.
4. Reach a goal with a clone:
    - That clone becomes stuck and acts as a static object (e.g., holding a switch down).
    - You cannot retract to clones that have reached their goal.
5. Use retraction to undo mistakes:
    - Erase your current clone and return to the previous one (unless itâ€™s stuck).
    - Useful for experimenting and iterating on solutions.

## Puzzle Elements
- Pressure plates/switches that must be held down.
- Doors or platforms activated by stuck clones.
- Obstacles requiring precise timing between clones.
- Hazards that require coordination between active and looping clones.

## Win/Lose Conditions
- Win: Get all required clones to their goal locations.
- Lose: All clones are stuck or destroyed, and you cannot progress.

## Visual/Audio Style
- Minimalist, clear silhouettes for clones.
- Distinct colors or effects to indicate stuck/active/looping clones.
- Subtle audio cues when creating, retracting, or sticking a clone.

### Optional Extensions
- Leaderboards for fewest clones used or fastest completion.
- Secret collectibles requiring clever clone use.
- Advanced puzzles with time-based mechanics.
