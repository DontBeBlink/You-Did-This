# About You Did This

**You Did This** is a solo development project by blink, created as a fun project to showcase reusable game systems and mechanics. This repository serves multiple purposes:

- **Playable Game**: A puzzle platformer demonstrating clone-based mechanics
- **System Showcase**: Modular, reusable game systems for other developers
- **Learning Resource**: Reference implementation of complex game mechanics
- **Portfolio Piece**: Demonstration of solo game development capabilities

## üéØ Project Purpose

### For blink (the developer)
- Fun project development with flexible timeline
- System design and implementation practice
- Potential foundation for future game projects
- Portfolio demonstration of technical capabilities

### For Other Solo Developers
- **Reusable Packages**: Modular systems you can adapt for your games
- **Learning Resource**: Study implementation of complex game mechanics
- **Reference Code**: Well-documented examples of Unity development patterns
- **Inspiration**: See how clone-based gameplay can be implemented

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Systems

This project includes several reusable packages that other developers might find useful:

### Clone Recording & Replay System
- Physics-perfect action recording at 50Hz
- Deterministic replay system for complex interactions
- Scalable to multiple simultaneous clones
- Modular design for easy integration

### Audio Management System
- Centralized audio management
- Event-driven sound effects
- Spatial audio support
- Easy integration with game events

### Interaction System
- Flexible object interaction framework
- Visual feedback system
- Physics-based throwing mechanics
- Extensible for custom interactions

## üéÆ Exploring the Code

### Getting Started
1. **Unity Installation**: Unity 6000.2.0b9 or later
2. **Clone Repository**: Download or clone this repository
3. **Open in Unity**: Use Unity Hub to open the project
4. **Test Play**: Open `Assets/Scenes/DemoScene.unity` and press Play
5. **Study Systems**: Explore the modular packages in the Packages/ directory

### Key Files to Study
- `Assets/Scripts/CloneManager.cs`: Central clone system controller
- `Assets/Scripts/ActionRecorder.cs`: Physics-perfect action recording
- `Assets/Scripts/Clone.cs`: Individual clone behavior and replay
- `Packages/`: Modular systems packaged for reuse

### Understanding the Architecture
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation of the systems and how they work together.

## üí° Questions & Feedback

### For Technical Questions
