# Enhanced Clone Retract System

## Overview

The enhanced clone retract system allows players to "undo" their clone creation by removing the most recent non-stuck clone and teleporting the player to that clone's current position in its loop. This feature includes smooth transition animations and audio feedback.

## New Features

### Player Position Movement
- When retracting, the player is moved to the target clone's current position
- Physics state is properly reset at the new location
- Works with the clone's current position in its replay loop

### Enhanced Visual Effects
- Reuses the same transition system as clone creation
- Player animation ("pickup" trigger) plays during retract
- Temporary player immobilization during transition
- Smooth camera effects and fade transitions

### Audio Integration
- Plays retract sound effect via AudioManager
- Consistent with existing clone system audio
- Respects master volume settings

## Usage

### Keyboard Input
```csharp
// New keyboard shortcut
Z Key - Retract to last clone position
```

### UI Button
```csharp
// Existing UI button still works
Retract Button - Same functionality via UI
```

### Programmatic Access
```csharp
CloneManager cloneManager = CloneManager.instance;
bool success = cloneManager.RetractToLastClone();
```

## How It Works

### 1. Find Target Clone
```csharp
// Finds the most recent non-stuck clone
Clone lastClone = null;
for (int i = allClones.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    if (!allClones[i].IsStuck)
    {
        lastClone = allClones[i];
        break;
    }
}
```

### 2. Play Transition Effects
```csharp
// Reuses clone creation transition system
yield return StartCoroutine(PlayRetractTransition(targetClone));
```

### 3. Move Player
```csharp
// Teleport player to clone's current position
Vector3 targetPosition = targetClone.transform.position;
activePlayer.transform.position = targetPosition;
character.SetPhysicsState(targetPosition, Vector2.zero, Vector2.zero);
```

### 4. Remove Newer Clones
```csharp
// Remove all clones created after the target clone
for (int i = allClones.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    if (allClones[i].CloneIndex > targetClone.CloneIndex)
    {
        Destroy(allClones[i].gameObject);
        allClones.RemoveAt(i);
    }
}
```

## Behavior Details

### Clone Selection
- Only targets non-stuck clones (stuck clones remain permanent)
- Selects the most recently created available clone
- Returns false if no valid clones are available

### Player Movement
- Player is moved to the clone's **current** position in its loop
- Not the clone's starting position, but where it is right now
- Physics state (velocity, forces) is reset to zero

### Animation Timing
- 0.5 second animation duration
- Player immobilized during transition
- Audio plays at the start of the transition
- Camera fade effects if CameraController is available

### State Management
- Stops current recording if active
- Resets recording state
- Maintains stuck clone permanence
- Updates clone indices properly

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **CloneManager**: Core retract logic enhanced
- **AudioManager**: Reuses existing retract sound
- **CameraController**: Uses existing fade duration
- **CharacterController2D**: Physics state management
- **PlayerController**: New Z key input handling

### With New Portal System
- **Shared Transitions**: Both systems use identical animation effects
- **Consistent Audio**: Both use the same retract sound
- **Code Reuse**: Portal system leverages retract transition methods

## Example Scenarios

### Basic Retract
1. Player creates clone at position A
2. Player moves to position B  
3. Player presses Z key
4. Player teleports back to clone's current position
5. Clone is destroyed

### Multi-Clone Retract
1. Player has 3 clones: Clone1 (stuck), Clone2, Clone3
2. Player presses Z key
3. Player teleports to Clone3's current position
4. Clone3 is destroyed, Clone1 and Clone2 remain

### No Available Clones
1. Player has only stuck clones or no clones
2. Player presses Z key
3. Debug message: "Cannot retract: No clones available or only stuck clones remain"
4. No action taken

## Technical Implementation

### Key Methods

#### Enhanced RetractToLastClone()
```csharp
public bool RetractToLastClone()
{
    // Find target clone
    // Start transition coroutine
    // Return success status
}
```

#### New PlayRetractTransition()
```csharp
private IEnumerator PlayRetractTransition(Clone targetClone)
{
    // Play animation and audio
    // Move player to target position
    // Reset physics state
    // Handle timing and effects
}
```

#### New HandleRetractInput() in PlayerController
```csharp
private void HandleRetractInput()
{
    // Keyboard input handling
    // CloneManager integration
    // Error feedback
}
```

## Benefits for Level Design

### Enhanced Puzzle Solving
- Players can more easily experiment with clone placement
- Reduces frustration from misplaced clones
- Encourages creative problem-solving approaches

### Improved Flow
- Faster iteration on puzzle solutions
- Smoother gameplay experience
- More forgiving mistake recovery

### Strategic Depth
- Players can use retract as part of the solution
- Creates new puzzle possibilities
- Adds timing-based challenge elements

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- Visual preview of retract destination
- Retract to specific clone (not just last)
- Chain retraction (multiple clones at once)
- Retract history/undo system

### Animation Improvements
- Custom retract animation instead of reusing "pickup"
- Particle effects during transition
- Camera zoom effects during retract
- Visual trail showing movement path

This enhanced retract system significantly improves the player experience while maintaining consistency with the existing clone system architecture.
