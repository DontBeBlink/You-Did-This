# Basic Interaction System Example

This sample demonstrates the core functionality of the Interaction System package, including:

- Basic object interaction (switches, buttons)
- Pickup and carry mechanics for movable objects
- Visual feedback with input device icons
- Integration with character controllers

## 📁 Contents

- **Scenes/**: Example scene showing interaction setup
- **Scripts/**: Example interaction behaviors
- **Prefabs/**: Pre-configured interaction objects

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open the `InteractionExample` scene
2. Press Play to test the interaction system
3. Use WASD/Arrow keys to move the character
4. Press E to interact with objects
5. Press Q to drop carried objects

## 🎯 What to Explore

### Basic Interactions
- **ColorSwitch**: Changes color when activated
- **CounterButton**: Counts the number of interactions
- **MessageTrigger**: Displays messages when interacted with

### Pickup Objects
- **Box**: Can be picked up, carried, and thrown
- **Key**: Lightweight pickup object
- **Heavy Crate**: Demonstrates physics-based object behavior

### Visual Feedback
- Icons automatically appear above interactable objects
- Icons change based on your input device (keyboard/gamepad)
- Visual highlighting when objects are in range

## 🔧 Technical Examples

The example scripts show how to:
- Create custom interactable behaviors
- Handle pickup object physics
- Integrate with the visual feedback system
- Use events for interaction responses
