Common game design goals: 
Skill and achievement (player should feel a sense of accomplishment)
Legibility/readability (Make the levels/game understandable)
Interest v boredom 
story/worldbuilding


2/1(or 3/1) ratio of productivity and fun. Make 2-3 things for the purpose of the project. Make 1 thing for fun. *general rule for solo dev

“Finish your first level last.” -John Romero (example: Super Mario first level was made last)

Any game with lots of levels should have varying sections of Themed levels.
Example: Moving Mountains: Speedy Level Creation as a Desperate Indie Dev
  (art variation) lvl 1-2 sand, lvl 3-7 warm, lvl 8-12 cool, lvl 13-17 warm, lvl 18-22 sand, lvl 23–27 cool, lvl 28-32 sand

Use contrast everywhere(light vs dark, open vs cramped)

Create easily recognisable landmarks in several places for easier navigation
